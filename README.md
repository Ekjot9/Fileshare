# Cloud Deployment (AWS)

The application is deployed on AWS with a secure and scalable network architecture using a custom VPC.

## VPC & Subnets

VPC: A dedicated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) hosts all application resources securely.

**Subnets:**

**Public Subnet:**

Hosts the application server (Spring Boot backend + frontend).

Assigned a public IP for internet access.

**Private Subnet:**

Hosts the MySQL database server.

No direct internet access for enhanced security.

## Secure Communication

The application server in the public subnet communicates with the MySQL server in the private subnet securely.

**Security group rules allow:**

Inbound MySQL traffic (port 3306) only from the public instance IP of the application server.

All other traffic to the private subnet is blocked from the internet.

## This ensures that:

The database is not exposed publicly.

Only the application server can access the database, maintaining secure separation.
